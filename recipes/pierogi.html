    <p>Here is how to make pierogi:</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup salted butter or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 strips bacon, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough. In a large bowl combine the flour and salt. Stir in ½ cup of water, eggs, and oil and mix
            until a shaggy dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough with floured hands
            until smooth, about 10 minutes. Cover with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes
            to an hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Add the potatoes and salt to a large pot and cover with 3 inches of cold water.
            Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until potatoes are fork tender,
            about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a second large bowl. Add the pepper, butter, and mint, and mash
            until mostly smooth. Adjust salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough in half, leaving half covered. On the lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough until ¼
            inch thick. Using a 3 inch biscuit cutter, cut out 12-15 pieces of dough. Repeat with the remaining dough
            and any dough scraps.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a rimmed baking sheet. Working with one piece at a time, gently roll each dough round until
            slightly thinner. Add 1 tablespoon of potato mixture to the center of each dough round. Using your finger,
            spread water along the edge of each round, then fold the edges together to form a crescent shape. Seal with
            a fork, being careful not to pinch in any filling, and transfer to the prepared sheet. See Note.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and salt it.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add the onion and bacon to a large skillet and cook over medium heat until the onion is tender
            and bacon begins to crisp, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add 4-5 pierogi to the pot at a time and cook until they are floating, about 2-3
            minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove them from the water, allowing excess water to drip off, and transfer
            to the skillet with the bacon and onion. Once all of the pierogi have been added to the skillet, cook over
            medium-high heat until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large platter.</li>
        <li>Serve family style with sour cream or cottage cheese on the side, if using.</li>
    </ol>
